# GFlowNets
In this repository the two uses of our GFlowNet implementation for graph clustering made for a 10 ECTS project in Artificial Intelligence at DTU are explained in seperate jupyter notebooks. The first one is on synthetically generated graphs and the second one on the iconic Karate Club graph.
